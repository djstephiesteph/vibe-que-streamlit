**VibeQue App Terms & Conditions**

**1. Introduction**  
Welcome to the VibeQue App. This platform allows users to submit song and line dance requests during live events. By using this platform, you agree to the following terms.

**2. Acceptance of Terms**  
Before submitting a request, users must agree to these terms. A brief consent checkbox will appear at submission, and a full version of these terms will be viewable via popup.

**3. User Conduct & Guidelines**  
Users agree to submit respectful and appropriate content. VibeQue reserves the right to filter, remove, or reject submissions that violate community standards.

**4. Request Submission Policy**  
Each user may submit up to four (4) requests per session. Additional requests are not guaranteed and may be delayed or denied depending on queue volume.

**5. Data Use & Privacy**  
Your name and a unique ID will be stored alongside your request for identification, queue management, and recognition purposes. No personal emails are collected or shared.

**6. Badge and Recognition Disclaimer**  
Recognition (e.g., Viber of the Week, top requestor) is based on submission data. Badges and rankings are awarded automatically and subject to change without notice.

**7. Cancellation & Queue Disclaimer**  
Requests may be removed or postponed by the DJ due to time limits, duplicates, or event changes. Users can cancel requests with an optional reason using their request cart.

**8. Third-Party Tools Disclosure**  
This app utilizes Google Sheets and related tools to manage submissions and queue data. By using the app, you consent to non-sensitive data being logged for functionality.

**9. Changes to Terms**  
VibeQue may update these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

**10. Contact Information**  
For questions about these terms, please contact the DJ or app admin directly during the event.
